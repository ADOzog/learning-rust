# Learning Rust

A collection of small projects written in rust to help me learn the language.



## Primes Project 
### (Completed on 1-1-2025)


It creates and prints a vector of primes numbers up to a certain number.
As of now, it is not perfectly optimized or very clean but it helped me to learn the basic syntax and how borrowing works.

## Factorization Project
### (Completed on 1-3-2025)

It factorizes numbers less than 10,000.
Could be expanded in the future to work without a vector of primes and just compute it on the spot based on the square root of the provided number.

## Linked List Project
### (Completed on 4-13-2025)

Creates and manipulates linked list.  
This was also my first time ever coding a linked list.    
I need to add deletion and insertion as well.
#### Note 
I have been regularly writing rust and reading "The Book" but I just have not had time to upload my projects to github.  
Also I have since learned to use cargo to manage my projects rather than uploading a single file at a time.
