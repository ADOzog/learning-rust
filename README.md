# Learning Rust
A collection of small projects written in rust to help me learn the language.



# Primes Project (Completed on 1-1-2025)


It creates and prints a vector of primes numbers up to a certain number.
As of now, it is not perfectly optimized or very clean but it helped me to learn the basic syntax and how borrowing works.
