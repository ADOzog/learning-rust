# Learning Rust
A collection of small projects written in rust to help me learn the language.



# Primes Project (Completed on 1-1-2025)


It creates and prints a vector of primes numbers up to a certain number.
As of now, it is not perfectly optimized or very clean but it helped me to learn the basic syntax and how borrowing works.

# Factorization Project (Completed on 1-3-2025)

It factorizes numbers less than 10,000.
Could be expanded in the future to work without a vector of primes and just compute it on the spot based on the square root of the provided number.
